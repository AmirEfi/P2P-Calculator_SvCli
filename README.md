# P2P-Calculator_SvCli
## Final Project of Computer Networking course - Spring 2023

This is my final project in the CN course.

The first part is a simple calculator that clients can request to the server and send their problems and then the server will respond with the answer and the computation time in Nano second.

The second part is a peer-to-peer network.
